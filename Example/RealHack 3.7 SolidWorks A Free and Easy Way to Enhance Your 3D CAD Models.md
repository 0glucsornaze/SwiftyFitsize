## What is Vengeance Producer Suite Metrum?
 
Vengeance Producer Suite Metrum is a kick drum synthesizer that was created by Vengeance Sound, a renowned company in the field of sound design and music production. Vengeance Sound has been making high quality sample packs, plugins and expansions for over 15 years, and has earned the trust and respect of many professional producers and DJs around the world.
 
Vengeance Producer Suite Metrum is one of their flagship products, and it is designed to give you the ultimate control over your kick drums. Unlike other plugins that use samples or presets, Metrum lets you synthesize your own kicks from scratch using three layers: top, mid and bottom. Each layer has its own oscillator, envelope, filter, distortion and effect section, and you can mix and match them to create endless combinations of kicks.
 
## Why do you need Vengeance Producer Suite Metrum?
 
The kick drum is one of the most important elements in any music genre, especially in electronic music. It sets the groove, the energy and the mood of your track. It can also make or break your mix, as a good kick can cut through the mix and glue everything together, while a bad kick can ruin your balance and clarity.
 
That's why you need Vengeance Producer Suite Metrum, because it gives you the power to create your own kicks that suit your style and taste. You don't have to rely on pre-made samples or presets that may not fit your track or genre. You can also fine-tune every parameter of your kicks with ease and precision, and adjust them to your mix with the built-in equalizer and limiter.
 
## How to use Vengeance Producer Suite Metrum?
 
Vengeance Producer Suite Metrum is very easy to use, thanks to its user-friendly interface and intuitive workflow. You can start by choosing one of the 330 kick drum presets that cover a wide range of genres and styles. You can then modify the preset by changing the oscillator type, pitch, volume, envelope, filter, distortion and effect settings for each layer. You can also swap the layers or mute them to create different variations of kicks.
 
If you want to create your own kicks from scratch, you can use the sine oscillator presets or drag and drop your own WAV samples into the oscillator slots. You can then shape your kicks with the graphic envelopes that show you exactly what you are doing in real time. You can also use the huge mod matrix to assign any parameter of Metrum to any modulation source, such as velocity, mod wheel or LFO.
