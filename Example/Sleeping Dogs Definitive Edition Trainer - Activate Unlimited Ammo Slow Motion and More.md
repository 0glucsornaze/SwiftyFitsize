# How to Use Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition Trainer to Enhance Your Gameplay
  
Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is a remastered version of the 2012 action-adventure game Sleeping Dogs, which follows the undercover cop Wei Shen as he infiltrates the Triads in Hong Kong. The game features an open world, a rich story, and a variety of gameplay elements such as martial arts, shooting, driving, and hacking.
  
However, if you want to spice up your gameplay and have some fun with the game's mechanics, you might want to use a trainer. A trainer is a software that modifies the game's memory and allows you to activate cheats such as unlimited health, ammo, money, or XP. Trainers can also give you access to features that are not normally available in the game, such as teleportation, one-hit kills, or no heat level.
