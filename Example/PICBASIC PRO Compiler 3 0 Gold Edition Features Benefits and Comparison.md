PBP has been in the market for over 15 years, and has been used by thousands of programmers in both commercial and non-commercial environments. PBP is compatible with most PIC microcontrollers, from the low-end PIC10F series to the high-performance PIC18F series. PBP can also generate code for the PIC16F1xxx Enhanced Mid-range Architecture devices.
 
Some of the features of PBP include:
 
- A user-friendly Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that helps you write, edit, debug, and program your code.
- A comprehensive library of built-in commands and functions that simplify common tasks such as serial communication, LCD display, PWM output, analog input, and more.
- A powerful macro preprocessor that allows you to create custom commands and expressions.
- A modular structure that lets you organize your code into separate files and include them as needed.
- An inline assembler that lets you insert assembly language instructions into your BASIC code.
- A code optimizer that reduces the size and improves the speed of your compiled code.
- A linker that allows you to combine multiple PBP files into a single executable file.
- A bootloader that enables you to program your PIC device without an external programmer.

PBP is available in three editions: Silver, Gold, and Platinum. The Gold Edition supports all the features of the Silver Edition, plus additional commands and functions, more device support, and more memory space. The Platinum Edition adds support for multi-tasking, floating-point arithmetic, USB communication, and more.
 
If you are looking for a programming language that is easy to learn, yet powerful enough to handle complex projects, then PBP is the right choice for you. You can download a free trial version of PBP from [^2^] and see for yourself how PBP can help you create amazing applications for PIC microcontrollers.
  
To get started with PBP, you will need a PIC microcontroller, a programmer or a bootloader circuit, and a PC with Windows operating system. You can use any text editor to write your PBP code, or you can use the IDE that comes with PBP. The IDE provides syntax highlighting, code completion, error checking, and other helpful features.
 
Once you have written your code, you can compile it using the PBP compiler. The compiler will check your code for syntax errors and generate an executable file that can be programmed into your PIC device. You can use the PBP linker to combine multiple PBP files into one executable file. You can also use the PBP optimizer to reduce the size and improve the speed of your compiled code.

To program your PIC device, you can use an external programmer such as PICkit or ICD, or you can use the PBP bootloader. The bootloader allows you to program your PIC device through a serial or USB connection, without the need for an external programmer. The bootloader also lets you update your code without removing the PIC device from the circuit.
 
PBP comes with a rich collection of examples and tutorials that show you how to use various commands and functions of PBP. You can also find more examples and resources on the PBP website  and on the PBP forum . There you can interact with other PBP users and get help and advice from experienced programmers.
