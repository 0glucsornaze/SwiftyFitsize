## How to Choose the Best Location for Your Patio Heater
 
One of the advantages of the Mojave Sun Infrared Freestanding Electric Patio Heater is that you can place it anywhere in your outdoor space. However, there are some factors to consider when choosing the best location for your patio heater. Here are some tips to help you:

- **Avoid windy areas:** Wind can reduce the effectiveness of infrared heating, as it can blow away the warm air and create cold drafts. Therefore, it is advisable to place your patio heater in a sheltered or enclosed area, such as under a canopy, pergola, or gazebo. You can also use curtains, screens, or walls to block the wind and create a cozy atmosphere.
- **Consider the sun exposure:** The sun can also affect the performance of your patio heater, as it can heat up your space during the day and cool it down at night. Therefore, it is advisable to place your patio heater in a sunny area during the winter, and in a shaded area during the summer. You can also use umbrellas, awnings, or trees to provide shade and protection from the sun.
- **Ensure enough clearance:** The Mojave Sun Infrared Freestanding Electric Patio Heater has a wide heating range of up to 15 square meters. However, you need to ensure enough clearance around the heater for safety and efficiency. You should keep at least 3 feet of distance from the heater to any combustible materials, such as furniture, plants, or fabrics. You should also keep at least 6 feet of distance from the heater to any people or pets.

## How to Care for Your Patio Heater
 
The Mojave Sun Infrared Freestanding Electric Patio Heater is designed to be low-maintenance and long-lasting. However, you still need to take some basic steps to care for your patio heater and extend its lifespan. Here are some tips to help you:

- **Clean it regularly:** You should clean your patio heater regularly to remove any dust, dirt, or debris that may accumulate on its surface or inside its housing. You can use a soft cloth or a vacuum cleaner to wipe or suck away any loose particles. You can also use a damp cloth or a mild detergent to remove any stains or spills. However, you should avoid using any abrasive materials or harsh chemicals that may damage the heater's finish or components.
- **Store it properly:** You should store your patio heater properly when not in use or during extreme weather conditions. You should unplug it from the power source and let it cool down completely before storing it. You should also cover it with a protective cover or a plastic bag to prevent any moisture or dust from entering it. You should store it in a dry and ventilated place, away from direct sunlight or heat sources.
- **Check it periodically:** You should check your patio heater periodically for any signs of damage or malfunction. You should inspect its cord, plug, switch, remote control, heating element, and LED display for any cracks, burns, loose connections, or defects. If you notice any problems, you should contact the manufacturer or a qualified technician for repair or replacement.
