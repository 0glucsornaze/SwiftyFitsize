> "Phoenix RC Flight Simulator: Having an interest in RC aircraft since childhood, I haven't actually participated in the hobby until now. What better way to dive in but to purchase a 3D Helicopter kit. After assembly and buying all the necessary accessories, my first flight lasted about 5 seconds. So after my first crash, and another $80 in parts, I got it back together....10 seconds of flying, and CRASH....now another $56 in parts....flight number three...well you get the idea. (I've spent over 3X the cost of the simulator in parts learning to fly) A friend of mine who got me to actually purchase the helicopter in the first place suggested I buy the Phoenix, I hesitated to do it just because I assumed that even though I have my commercial pilots license, the simulator would not be necessary. I was wrong. I purchased the software/cable and it plugs right in to my transmitter. What a GREAT tool. I have spent hours and hours actually learning to fly the exact model of my \"real life RC helicopter\". I can now fly my helicopter with confidence for basic techniques and working on more advanced skills on this sim first as they are much harder to master." - Trashman

> "I have had Phoenix for a little over a year. During that time I was able to add at least 20 new airplanes at no cost. The software will ask you if you want to download the new planes. couple of mouse later you have new planes! I think all of the others call these expansion packs and charge money." - John
