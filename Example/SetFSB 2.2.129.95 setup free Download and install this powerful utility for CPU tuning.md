# How to Overclock Your CPU with SetFSB 2.2.129.95 for Free
 
If you want to boost the performance of your PC or laptop, overclocking your CPU is one of the easiest and cheapest ways to do it. Overclocking means increasing the clock speed of your processor beyond its default value, which can result in faster processing and better gaming experience. However, overclocking can also be risky if you don't know what you're doing, as it can cause overheating, instability, or even damage to your hardware.
