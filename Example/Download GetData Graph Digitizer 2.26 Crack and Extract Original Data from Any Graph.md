GetData Graph Digitizer 2.26 is a program for digitizing graphs and plots. It allows you to easily get the numbers from graphs by scanning them or importing them from image files. You can then save the extracted data as text, Excel, or XML files.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use GetData Graph Digitizer 2.26 to extract data from graphs and plots in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install GetData Graph Digitizer 2.26
 
The first step is to download and install GetData Graph Digitizer 2.26 on your Windows computer. You can get it from the official website[^1^] or from other sources[^2^] [^3^]. The program is not free, but you can try it for 21 days before purchasing it.
 
Once you have downloaded the setup file, run it and follow the instructions to install the program on your computer. You will need to enter your name and email address to activate the trial version.
 
## Step 2: Open a Graph or Plot Image File
 
The next step is to open a graph or plot image file that you want to digitize. You can scan a graph or plot from a paper document using a scanner, or you can import an image file from your computer or online sources.
 
To open an image file, click on the File menu and select Open Image File. You can also use the Ctrl+O keyboard shortcut. A dialog box will appear where you can browse and select the image file that you want to open. The supported image formats are TIFF, JPEG, BMP, and PCX.
 
Once you have opened an image file, it will be displayed in the main window of the program. You can zoom in or out using the mouse wheel or the toolbar buttons. You can also rotate or flip the image using the Edit menu options.

## Step 3: Set Up the Axes and Calibration Points
 
The third step is to set up the axes and calibration points for the graph or plot. This is necessary to tell the program how to map the pixels on the image to the actual data values on the graph or plot.
 
To set up the axes, click on the Axes menu and select Set Axes Type. A dialog box will appear where you can choose the type of axes for your graph or plot. The available options are linear, logarithmic, polar, date/time, and custom.
 
After choosing the axes type, click on OK and then click on Set Axes on the toolbar. You will need to mark four points on the image that correspond to known data values on the graph or plot. For example, if your graph has linear axes with x ranging from 0 to 10 and y ranging from 0 to 100, you can mark four points at (0,0), (10,0), (0,100), and (10,100). A dialog box will appear where you can enter the data values for each point.
 
Once you have entered the data values for each point, click on OK and then click on Apply Calibration on the toolbar. The program will calculate the calibration coefficients and display them in the status bar at the bottom of the window.
 
## Step 4: Digitize Data Points or Lines
 
The fourth step is to digitize data points or lines from the graph or plot. There are two modes for digitizing: manual and automatic.
 
In manual mode, you can use your mouse cursor to mark data points or lines on the image. To mark data points, click on Add Points on the toolbar and then click on each point that you want to digitize on the image. The program will display a crosshair cursor and show the data value of
